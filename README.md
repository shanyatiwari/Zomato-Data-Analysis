# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Zomato is an internet giant connecting resturants to millions of customers. This research is conducted with a motive to answer the following questions:
(a) Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
(b) Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
(c) What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?
After substantial analysis we have concluded that :
1 - Dining restaurants are preferred by a larger number of individuals.
2 - majority of the restaurants do not accept online orders.
3 - Offline orders received lower ratings in comparison to online orders, which obtained excellent ratings.
Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
