# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Zomato is an internet giant connecting restaurants to millions of customers. This research is conducted with a motive to answer the following questions:

(a) Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?

(b) Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?

(c) What price range do couples prefer for their dinner at restaurants?

After substantial analysis, we have concluded that :

1 - A larger number of individuals prefer dining in restaurants.

2 - the majority of the restaurants do not accept online orders.

3 - Offline orders received lower ratings in comparison to online orders, which obtained excellent ratings.

4 - Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
